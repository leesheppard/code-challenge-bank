## Task

- You are a developer for a company that runs a very simple banking service.
- Each day companies provide you with a CSV file with transfers they want to make between accounts for customers they are doing business with.

- The task is to implement a simple system that can load account balances for a single company and then accept a day's transfers in a CSV file.
